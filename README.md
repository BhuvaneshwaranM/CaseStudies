## <a name="Introduction"></a>Introduction
The Iris flower data set or Fisher's Iris data set is a multivariate data set introduced by the British statistician and biologist Ronald Fisher in his 1936 paper The use of multiple measurements in taxonomic problems as an example of linear discriminant analysis.
- The dataset consists of 50 samples from each of three species of Iris (Iris-setosa, Iris-virginica and Iris-versicolor).

- Four features were measured from each sample (in centimetres): 
  - Length of the sepals
  - Width of the sepals
  - Length of the petals
  - Width of the petals
  
## <a name="Aim of the CaseStudy"></a>Aim of the CaseStudy
 Building classification model to classify flowers into species of Iris based on the features.
 
## <a name="Working with Dataset"></a>Working with Dataset
 - Initially the dataset is loaded and initial pre-processing and exploratory data analysis is done.
 - Used the classification algorithms to classify the data:
    - Logistic Regression
    - Decision Tree
    - K Nearest Neighbours

## <a name="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion
The KNN Algorithm was found to be the best performing generalized model in classifying into Iris species based on the records.
